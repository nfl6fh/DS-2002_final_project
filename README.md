# DS-2002_final_project
## Nathan Lindley

This is my final project for DS 2002 in the Fall 2022 semester. It is a discord bot that can be asked questions about a netflix dataset and will respond using queries of a MongoDB. It also has the ability to respond to user questions with answers generated by OpenAI's gpt-3 algorithm, as well as generate images from user prompts using their AI image generation API.

## How to run with full functionality
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a file called .env in the root directory of the project
3. Add the following to the .env file
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your discord bot token>
MONGO_URI=<your mongo uri>
OPENAI_API_TOKEN=<your openai api token>
```
4. Ensure you have the following python packages installed (this can be done by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of the project)
```
discord
pymongo
openai
requests
python-dotenv
pandas
```
5. Run the main.py file with `python main.py` in the root directory of the project
6. Invite the bot to your server with admin permissions (You can give it fewer permissions if you want, but it will not work as intended without a change to the intents in main.py)

## How to run as a demo bot in terminal
Functionality available in the terminal:
```
!help
getting answers about the netflix dataset
```
Functionality not available in the terminal:
```
gpt3 responses
image generation
```
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have the pymongo python package installed
3. Run the main.py file with `python main.py --demo` in the root directory of the project
4. Interact with the bot in the terminal as you would in a discord chat
